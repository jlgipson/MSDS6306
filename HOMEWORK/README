Hi, My name is Johnny Gipson and this branch of the repository is for all Homework assignments for MSDS6306. 
You will see JGipson_Assignment3.rmd and JGipson_Assignment3.html from Rstudio for Live Session Unit 3 Assignment.  
In this assignment,we obtained the titantic data set from  https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets. 
We used this data to create to plot some frequency and use the apply statement in R studio.  We also used the 
sleep data from http://talklab.psy.gla.ac.uk/L1_labs/lab_1/homework/index.html for practice in creating
functions.  The last data set we used was from fivethirtyeight and the file was obtained from 
https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight. We used the college data recent grad date set from fivethirtyeight 
to help with with Rstudio coding for manipulating data.  The college,sleep,and titantic data set are available as csv files
on this page or you can go to the source which were mentioned earlier in the text.

Added files to the repository are JGipson_Assignment5.rmd, JGipson_Assignment5.html, yob2015.txt, yob2016.txt, 
Top_Ten_Girl_Names.csv, and a Codebook.  The Codebook will give all the revelant information needed to help reproduce the work.
